Each team must agree on all three points, or the match scheduling is incomplete.

Competitors are strongly urged to post their complete match schedules to avoid any possibility of miscommunication or dispute about these details at match time.

### 5.3 Casting

The staff will honor reasonable requests to the best of their ability, weighing conflicting obligations, the significance of the match to the tournament results, and the seriousness of concerns about improper behavior that may take place.

### 5.5 Ringers

A defining characteristic of a championship team is the capacity to field a team for a match at the agreed upon date and time. Therefore, both teams must agree to allow ringers, or ringers will not be allowed.

#### 5.5.2 Limits on ringers

Each team must field at least three (3) rostered players in each match, regardless of consent from the opponent.

### 5.6 Demos are mandatory

Each participant is required to record and save demos of their match play. All demos must be stored until the end of the tournament, and must be submitted promptly to a Tournament Director on request.
To record a demo, open the console and type `record <demoname>`.  It is not necessary to re-record after a map change, but it is necessary to re-record after disconnecting from the server for any reason.

#### 5.6.1 Screenshots are mandatory

Each team is allowed up to one (1) pause per round to request screenshots.

Each player must take a screenshot whenever asked by anyone on the server.

#### 5.6.2 Privacy

Players are never required to provide demos or screenshots to anyone except the staff. Although there is no basis for an expectation of privacy, they are considered confidential and will be shared only for:

Asking second opinions of skilled players who are trusted to keep what they find in confidence
To expose wrongdoing to the community if, and only if, it is discovered

#### 5.6.3 Responsibility is with you

It is each player’s individual responsibility to ensure that demos and screenshots are recorded, uncorrupted, and submitted in a timely manner.

#### 5.7 Exploits

#### 5.7.1 AI pathing exploits

It is illegal to intentionally exploit AI pathing by moving to an area that causes NPC infected to stop attacking.

A typical penalty for intentionally exploiting AI pathing will be a zero score for the round.

#### 5.7.2 Tank pathing

If an AI tank stops advancing for any reason, the survivors must be notified in a reasonable time. Intentionally positioning a tank so that it cannot advance when AI controlled is not allowed.

A typical penalty will be equivalent to full map distance and health bonus at the time of the infraction.

#### 5.7.3 Spectate command

It is illegal to use the !spectate command excessively or in a way that gains an unfair advantage.

Historically, accepted uses of the spectate command have been:

If the player is out of bounds or has become stuck in an object and cannot  move or attack the survivors
If a player-controlled SI is not being killed by the survivors in a reasonable time (e.g. instead of killing a spitter/boomer, the survivors are m2ing it for >10 seconds)
If the server crashed at some point during the match and it is necessary to spectate in order to ensure a proper tank rotation

If a player spectates in a way that staff judge to be abusive, a typical penalty will be a zero score for the round.

#### 5.7.4 "Stuck spots"

It is illegal to exploit "stuck spots" by intentionally becoming stuck in a map entity. If a player-controlled special infected is teleported in this way, it must be killed via !spectate. If a tank is teleported, it must be slain via SourceMod or a vote-kick.

#### 5.7.5 Death Toll bridge

As survivors, it is illegal to cross the bridge on c10m1_caves without climbing a ladder.

#### 5.7.6 Spawn glitches

As infected, it is illegal to clip through a brush or other obstruction by spawning while passing through it in "ghost mode".

The minimum penalty will be a match loss by forfeit.

#### 5.7.7 Attacking from out of bounds

As infected, it is illegal to attack the survivors in any way from out of the normal map bounds, i.e. spawning under the map to attack survivors.

### 5.8: Glitches

5.8.1 Rescue vehicles
In the event of a finale rescue vehicle glitch (most common on Swamp Fever, but also possible on Dark Carnival and Hard Rain) the half will be replayed following a restart round. If necessary the final scores will be calculated manually.

#### 5.8.2 Un-clearable survivors

In some extremely rare cases, a pinned survivor cannot be cleared after an infected player gains control of the tank. In that event, either team may request that the round be replayed. If requested, the tournament directors may review demos and determine if the result of the replayed round will be used, or if some other action will be taken according to the circumstances.

## Section 6: Addons and configuration

## Section 7: Unsportsmanlike conduct

Each participant is expected to hold themselves to a high standard of professional and courteous conduct toward others at all times. Abusive, harassing, disrespectful, or unsportsmanlike conduct will not be tolerated -- either during a tournament match nor in any other venue.

### 7.1 Insufficient effort to win

Any competitor who, in the judgment of a staff member, has not committed their full effort to winning the match is guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct.

### 7.2 Excessive pausing
